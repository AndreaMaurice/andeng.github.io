          I'm a BS Information Systems graduate and a passionate Web
          Developer and Designer at that. I started my coding journey when I
          took Information and Communications Technonlogy during my SHS years
          and was inspired by my friends to continue this path.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As of now, I'm working into becoming a better developer who's continuously improving IT skills to provide better experiences through my applications.
